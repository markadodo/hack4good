MindsConnect is a 3-in-1 management integrated program designed to bridge the gap between participants, volunteers, and staff. 
It optimizes administrative efficiency, reduces manual workloads, and streamlines the activity sign-up process.

Problem statement (For Minds): 
How might we reduce friction in activity sign-ups for both individuals and caregivers, while reducing manual effort for staff in managing and consolidating registration data?
